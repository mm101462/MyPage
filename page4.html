  <h1>Thor Odinson</h1>

  <p>
    There was a god named Thor, the god of thunder, and the son of Odin. Odin gifted him a magical hammer called Mjölnir. However, when Thor disobeyed his father and fought the Frost Giants, his hammer was taken away, and he was sent to Earth. On Earth, a monster attacked, and even though Thor didn't have his hammer, he still fought the giant. For his bravery, Thor was reunited with Mjölnir and was able to defeat the giant.
