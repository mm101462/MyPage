    <h1>Captain America Origin</h1>
    
    <p>
      There was a skinny boy named Steve Rogers, who was from Brooklyn. At the time, there was a warâ€” 
      in fact, that war was World War II. Steve Rogers wanted to fight for his country, but when he applied, 
      there were a lot of health issues, and poor Steve was too thin. However, they offered him a deal: 
      if he volunteered for a super-soldier serum experiment, he would be given the chance. Of course, 
      Steve said yes. After taking the serum, he became a super-soldier known as Captain America.
