    <h1>Iron-Man Origin Story</h1>
    <p>Once there was a wealthy billionaire named Tony Stark, known for designing advanced weapons. One day, while showcasing his latest creations to military officials, he was kidnapped by a terrorist group. They forced him to build a powerful missile in a hidden cave. However, Tony had other ideas. Using his brilliant mind and limited resources, he secretly built a suit of high-tech armor instead. The suit helped him escape from his captors, and once free, he began refining his designs, eventually creating even more advanced suits of armor to protect the world.</p>
